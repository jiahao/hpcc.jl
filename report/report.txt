For the report we expect a short description of the implementation, the performance achieved, lines-of-code, and the actual source code used. More specifically the short description may include: 

Explanation of why the implementation should be considered for the award.
Identify specific benchmarks implemented and run.
Code size measured with source lines of code (see: http://icl.cs.utk.edu/projectsfiles/hpcc/download/sclc.pl) or equivalent.
Identify and explain any differences with the official HPC Challenge v1.0 benchmark.
Description of implementation environment, language, and tools used.
Identify all relevant libraries used.
Description of the system the benchmark was run on.
Description of problem sizes of run.
Performance relative to reference HPC Challenge benchmark.
Discussion of the effort and expertise required to implement and run the benchmark.
References to additional supporting data on the environment used for the implementation.
